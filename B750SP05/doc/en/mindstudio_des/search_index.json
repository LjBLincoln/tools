Studio is an AI full-stack development platform developed based on Huawei's neural-network processing unit (NPU). On Mind Studio, you can develop chip-based operators, and develop custom operators. Network migration, optimization, and analysis at the network layer is also supported. In addition, the service engine layer provides a set of visualized AI engine drag-and-drop programming services, which greatly reduces the AI engine development threshold. The entire platform provides the following four services for developers in a Web manner.\n\nFor operator development:\nMind Studio provides development of a full set of operators. It supports running in a real environment, visualized debugging of heterogeneous programs that are dynamically scheduled and third-party operator development, greatly reducing the operator development threshold based on Huawei-developed NPUs, improving the efficiency of operator development and enhancing product competitiveness.\n\nFor development at the network layer:\nMind Studio integrates the offline model conversion tool (OMG), model quantization tool, model running profiling tool, and log analysis tool, greatly improving the efficiency of migration, analysis and optimization of network models.\n\nFor AI engine development:\nMind Studio provides the AI engine that supports visualized drag-and-drop programming and a large number of automatic algorithm code generation technologies, largely reducing the threshold for developers. Mind Studio is equipped with various algorithm engines, such as ResNet-18, boosting the development and migration efficiency of the user AI algorithm engine.\n\nFor application development:\nMind Studio integrates various tools, such as Profile and Compiler, providing a graphically integrated development environment.

You can implement service orchestration by simply dragging and connecting service nodes. The one-stop service after orchestration, ranging from compilation and running to result display, makes process development smarter. \"Zero\" programming is involved. In this way, you can get started quickly without extra learning costs.\n\nGraphical TE programming\nMind Studio provides the industry's first integrated development environment based on the TVM-based Tensor Engine (TE) for programming development. Operators can be transplanted quickly across platforms, enabling instant NPU adaption.\n\nLog analysis\nMind Studio provides a system-wide log collection and analysis solution for the NPU platform, improving the efficiency of locating runtime algorithm problems. A unified log format is adopted. Visualized analysis of cross-platform logs and runtime diagnosis runs in Web mode, improving the usability of the log analysis system.\n\nPerformance analysis\nMind Studio provides graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and command-line interfaces (CLIs) to implement efficient, easy-to-use, and flexible performance profiling on the multi-node and multi-module heterogeneous system on the host and device. Synchronous analysis of performance and power consumption of the NPU device is implemented, which meets the requirements of algorithm optimization for system performance analysis.\n\nSimulation\nFunction-level simulation execution libraries for the AI core are provided.
