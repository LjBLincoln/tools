Media is an API media library that helps developers easily obtain camera-captured images and audio data. The media library runs on the application layer of the Ascend 310-powered OS on the Atlas DK developer board. Video streams and audio streams in various formats can be easily obtained by calling API functions. These APIs also allow you to easily control the operating modes of the cameras and MIC devices on the Atlas DK developer board and query their operating status and various supported parameters.\nHiAI Media can:\n\nInitialize the media library.\nControl media devices, including enabling and disabling cameras and microphones and setting parameters for operating, such as the frame rate, resolution, and audio sampling rate.\nQuery the supported operating modes and current running status of media devices, such as the supported resolution and the online status of cameras.\nCollect audio and video streams and processes the raw audio and video data based on the algorithms according to user-defined requirements.\n\n"},"media-library-apis.html":{"url":"media-library-apis.html","title":"Media Library APIs","keywords":"","body":"Media Library APIs\nThe APIs of HiAI Media are based on the C language.
