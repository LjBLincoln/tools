Log threads mounted to the IDE-daemon-device module are sent to the IDE-daemon-host module on the host side.\n\nSaving logs to files\nLogs on the device side are recorded in log files whose names start with  device-0  by IDE-daemon-host. Logs on the host side are recorded in log files whose names start with  host-0  by slogd. IDE-daemon-host starts the TCP/IP thread and sends host logs to Mind Studio.\nThe host records logs in log files in customized compression mode. You can view the log information in Mind Studio, but cannot view logs directly through the log files. The log information is displayed as garbled characters when you directly open a log file.\nTo change the log level, run the IDE-daemon-client command.

When this parameter is set to ON, the PMU event on the control CPU is profiled. Currently, the default events are 0x11 and 0x8, where 0x11 indicates the number of cycles executed by the CPU and 0x8 indicates the number of executed instructions.\n\n\nTS CPU Profiling\n\nWhether to enable profiling for the AI task schedule (TS) CPU. When this parameter is set to ON, the PMU event on the TS CPU is profiled. Currently, the default events are 0x11 and 0x8, where 0x11 indicates the number of cycles executed by the CPU and 0x8 indicates the number of executed instructions.\n\n\nAI CPU Profiling\n\nWhether to enable profiling for the AI operator CPU (different from the AI core CPU). When this parameter is set to ON, the PMU event on the AI CPU is profiled. Currently, the default events are 0x11 and 0x8, where 0x11 indicates the number of cycles executed by the CPU and 0x8 indicates the number of executed instructions.\n\n\nCPU Sampling Intervals(ms)\n\nPMU event profiling interval of the control CPU, TS CPU, and AI CPU. The default value is 20 (ms).\n\n\nAI Core Profiling\n\nProcessing unit responsible for the scalar, cube, and FP AI computation. Task-based and sample-based AI core profiling is supported. Currently, the default events are 0x3, 0x8, 0x9, 0xe, 0x3a, 0x3b, 0x4a, and 0x49. 0x3 indicates the number of executed cube instructions, 0x8 indicates the number of executed vector instructions, 0x9 indicates the number of executed scalar instructions, 0xe indicates the total number of instruction cycles, 0x3a indicates the number of scalar read requests for the UB, 0x3b indicates the number of scalar write requests for the UB, 0x4a indicates the number of cube int instructions, and 0x49 indicates the number of cube FP instructions. In task-based mode, the performance data is profiled by task, while in sample-based mode, the performance data is profiled at a fixed interval.\n\n\nPeripheral Profiling\n\nWhether to enable profiling for the peripherals. Currently, the supported peripherals are the digital vision pre-process (DVPP) and network interface collector (NIC). The default profiling interval is 10 ms.\n\n\nLLC Capacity\n\nWhether to enable profiling for the capacity information of the last level cache (LLC). This switch is mutually exclusive with the LLC bandwidth switch. Only one type of LLC data can be profiled at a time. Sampling Intervals indicates the LLC profiling interval. The value range is [100, 1000]. The default value is 100 (ms).\n\n\nLLC Bandwidth\n\nWhether to enable profiling for the read and write bandwidths of the LLC. This switch is mutually exclusive with the LLC capacity switch. Only one type of LLC data can be profiled at a time. Sampling Intervals indicates the LLC profiling interval. The value range is [100, 1000]. The default value is 100 (ms).\n\n\nDDR Profiling\n\nWhether to enable profiling for the read and write bandwidths of the DDR SDRAM. The default setting is OFF.\nMaster ID indicates the core whose read and write bandwidths are to be profiled. The value range is 0–7. 0–3 correspond to the core IDs of the control CPU. 4–7 correspond to the core IDs of the AI CPU.\nSampling Intervals indicates the DDR profiling interval. The value range is [100, 1000]. The default value is 100 (ms).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n NOTE:   \n\nThe performance monitor unit (PMU) is a hardware unit of the CPU. The CPU performance data can be read by accessing related registers.  \nDVPP is short for digital vision pre-process.  \nNIC is short for network interface controller.  \nIt is recommended that the DDR and LLC sampling intervals be not greater than the time required for program execution.
