document describes how to install Mind Studio, troubleshoot faults during the installation, and upgrade Mind Studio online.\n\nMind Studio is an AI full-stack development platform developed based on Huawei-developed NPUs. It provides web services such as chip-based operator development, debugging, optimization, and third-party operator development. Mind Studio also supports network migration, optimization, and analysis at the network layer and a set of visualized AI engine-based drag-and-drop programming services at the service engine layer, which greatly lowers the AI engine development threshold.\nThe device development kit （DDK） is a NPU-based digital developer suite. The DDK can be used to build a compilation environment for projects. Different release packages integrate DDKs of different NPU forms. The DDK of the current version contains the dependency libraries and header files of components such as the TE, DVPP, and process orchestration. Users can compile the project files by using  makefile.\n\n"},"privacy-statement.html":{"url":"privacy-statement.html","title":"Privacy Statement","keywords":"","body":"Privacy Statement\n\nAbout Third-Party Content  \n\nAbout Third-Party Tools  \n\nAbout Personal Data  \n\n\n"},"about-third-party-content.html":{"url":"about-third-party-content.html","title":"About Third-Party Content","keywords":"","body":"About Third-Party Content\n\nThis document may contain third-party content, such as third-party information, products, services, software, components, and data.

The gdb and gcc tools need to be reserved so that users can compile and debug applications after opening them.\nApplication scenario: Users utilize the programming tools to develop applications, use gcc to compile programs, and use gdb to debug programs. The tools are used only in the development environment instead of the production environment.\nRisk: Attackers may use the existing debugging and compilation tools to compile new programs, causing secondary attacks on the system. It is recommended that these tools be used only in the development environment.\n\n"},"about-personal-data.html":{"url":"about-personal-data.html","title":"About Personal Data","keywords":"","body":"About Personal Data\nPersonal Data\n\nUsage Scenario\n\nWhen logging in to Mind Studio, the user needs to enter the user name and password. The IP address of the host is collected.\nThe data set imported by the user is used when the model is used for performing inference. The data set may contain personal privacy data.\n\n\nCollected Items\n\nIP address, user name, password, and data set\n\n\nCollection Source and Method\n\nUser names and passwords are collected during user registration, IP addresses are collected during login and logout, and data sets are uploaded by users.\n\n\nPurpose and Security Protection Measure\n\nUser names and passwords are used as credentials for user login authentication. IP addresses are used to identify the client for user operations during audit, and data sets are used by users to perform inference on data. In addition, when you use Mind Studio, the server where Mind Studio is installed records your latest account login and operation logs. The operation logs include the IP address and user name for security audit.Data is transmitted under HTTPS-based encryption.User names and passwords are encrypted using PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256 and stored on the local Mind Studio server. IP addresses are recorded in logs in plain text. Log files are controlled by the permission (600) and data sets are controlled by the permission (600).\n\n\nData Retention Period and Policy\n\nThe system forcibly changes the user name and password every three months by default.The log data collected by Mind Studio is recorded on the host where Mind Studio is deployed. Therefore, the log can be manually deleted and cleared by the user. The maximum size of an operation log file is 20 MB. If the maximum size is exceeded, a new operation log file is generated. The maximum number of operation log files is 30. If the maximum number is exceeded, the generated operation log files overwrite the earliest operation log files.Due to repeated inference, data sets are retained on the Mind Studio server during inference.\n\n\nClearance Method\n\nUsers can delete personal data (such as the user names, passwords, IP addresses, and imported data sets) by uninstalling Mind Studio or on the GUI.Users can delete personal data by using profiling on the GUI.Due to repeated inference, data sets are stored in the ~/HIAI_DATANDMODELSET/workspace_mind_studio directory of the server on the host during inference and need to be cleared by users.\n\n\n\nData Export Method (Interfaces or Commands) and Implementation Scheme (Anonymization or Pseudonymization)\n\nN/A\n\n\nData Export Instructions\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n"},"environment-preparation.html":{"url":"environment-preparation.html","title":"Environment Preparation","keywords":"","body":"Environment Preparation\nTo run Mind Studio successfully, ensure that the server and client environments are prepared.\n\nServer  \n\nClient  \n\n\n"},"server.html":{"url":"server.html","title":"Server","keywords":"","body":"Server\n\nPreparing the Server Environment  \n\nSetting a Common User  \n\nSetting the Source  \n\nInstalling Dependent Packages  \n\n\n"},"preparing-the-server-environment.html":{"url":"preparing-the-server-environment.html","title":"Preparing the Server Environment","keywords":"","body":"Preparing the Server Environment\nThe server serves as the installation environment of Mind Studio.

Otherwise, the OS may be unstable.If the configurations of the Linux host are upgraded, for example, the memory is expanded to 8 GB, the supported operation specifications should be increased proportionally.For example, if the memory is expanded from 4 GB to 8 GB, the size threshold of the model file should be 700 MB.\n\n\n\nOS\n\n16.04.3\n\nDownload the required version from http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/16.04.3/. You can download the desktop version ubuntu-XXX-desktop-amd64.iso or server version ubuntu-XXX-server-amd64.iso.\n NOTE: In ubuntu-XXX-desktop-amd64.iso and ubuntu-XXX-server-amd64.iso, XXX indicates the version number.\n\n\nEnsure that the OS supports the UTF-8 character set. Otherwise, you cannot view the support documents by using online help of Mind Studio after the installation. For details about the troubleshooting solution, see What Do I Do If I Cannot View the Online Help Documents?.During model conversion, if a custom TE plug-in is loaded, the GUI may be stuck. Run the uname -r or cat /proc/version command to check whether the Linux kernel version is earlier than 4.18.

The password is changed successfully.\nEnter new UNIX password:\nRetype new UNIX password:\n\n\nChanging the Password of the MongoDB User \n\nMake sure that a Mind Studio project is started.\nRun the  java -version  command in the Linux CLI to check whether the JDK has been installed and JDK environment variable has been configured.\nFigure  1  Checking whether the JDK has been installed and JDK environment variable has been configured\n\n NOTE:If the JDK is not installed or the JDK environment variable is not configured, an error is reported when the MongoDB password is changed, and the modification fails.  \n\n\nLog in to the Mind Studio server as the Mind Studio installation user, go to the  tools/scripts  directory, and run the  mongoPwdUpdate.sh  script to change the MongoDB password\nby running the following command:\nsh mongoPwdUpdate.sh\nEnter the password according to the system output.\nPlease enter your admin user old password:\nPlease enter your admin user new password:\nPlease enter your admin user new password again:\nPlease enter your minddbuser user new password:\nPlease enter your minddbuser user new password again:\n\n NOTE:   \n\nA password must contain at least eight characters, including letters, digits, and special characters （excluding @ % and spaces）.  \nIf the password is successfully changed, the following message is displayed:  update mongodb pwd success!!!!  \nIf the password is changed for the first time, the default password of the  admin user is  abJ!19bj.  \n~/tools  is the default  toolpath  setting, which can be customized during Mind Studio installation. You can view the value of  toolpath in the  scripts/env.conf  file. You can run the  find / -name 'env.conf'  command to view the location of the  env.conf  file in the  script directory.  \n\n\n\nRefresh the Mind Studio project and check whether the functions are normal.\nFigure  2  Refreshing the Mind Studio project\n\n\nUpdating the Key for Encrypting Character Strings\nContext\nAfter Mind Studio is installed, a key for encrypting character strings is provided by default. The key is managed in a two-layer structure, including the root key and working key. In scenarios such as changing the password of the MongoDB user and changing the password of the Mind Studio certificate key store, the system uses the working key to encrypt the character strings. You are advised to update the key periodically （for example, every 90 days）.\nYou can log in to the Mind Studio server as the Mind Studio installation user, view the working key  work_key.json  in  ~/mongo/config/keygen, and view the root key in  ~/mongo/config/keygen/rootkey.\nProcedure\n\nLog in to the Mind Studio server as the Mind Studio installation user and go to the  ~/tools/bin  directory.\nRun the following command to update the key:\n./updateMongoKey.sh\nAfter the command is executed, the system stops the Mind Studio （including Profiling）, updates the key, and restarts the Mind Studio （including Profiling）. After the key is updated, a new root key and a new working key are generated in the  ~/mongo/config/keygen  directory, and the files there before the key update are backed up.\n\nThe backup file  crt.conf_bak of the crt.conf  file is generated in  ~/tools/scripts.\nThe backup file  profiler.cfg_bak  of the  profiler.cfg  file is generated in  ~/tools/conf.\nThe backup file  redis.cfg_bak  of the  redis.cfg  file is generated in  ~/tools/conf.\nThe backup directory  config_bak of the  config directory is generated in  ~/mongo.\nThe backup file workkey.img_bak  of the  workkey.img file is generated in  ~/tools/vendor.\n\nIf an exception occurs during key update, all operations are rolled back, that is, the status before the key update is returned. If the rollback fails, you need to manually restore the  *_bak  backup files and folder and restart Mind Studio. Run the following command to restart the Mind Studio in the  ~/tools/bin  directory:\nbash stop.sh\nbash start.sh\n\n NOTE:~/tools  is the default  toolpath  setting, which can be customized during Mind Studio installation. You can view the value of  toolpath in the  scripts/env.conf  file. You can run the  find / -name 'env.conf'  command to view the location of the  env.conf  file in the  script directory.  \n\n\n\n"},"changing-the-ip-addresses.html":{"url":"changing-the-ip-addresses.html","title":"Changing the IP addresses","keywords":"","body":"Changing the IP addresses\nIf you want to change the IP address of the Ubuntu server, the IP address used for Mind Studio installation needs to be changed as well.\n\nIf the IP address in the  env.conf  file is the IP address of the Ubuntu server, change it to the new IP address of the Ubuntu server.\nIf the IP address in the  env.conf file is set to  any:\nIf  use_eth0 in the  env.conf  file is set to  true, change the IP address of eth0 and restart Mind Studio for the new IP address to take effect.\nIf  use_eth0 in the  env.conf  file is set to  false, restart Mind Studio and select one from the IP addresses of multiple network adapters for the new IP address to take effect.\n\n\n\n\n NOTE:The path of the  env.conf file is as follows:  ~/tools/scripts/env.conf  \n\n"},"version-upgrade.html":{"url":"version-upgrade.html","title":"Version Upgrade","keywords":"","body":"Version Upgrade\nOnline upgrade of Mind Studio and Atlas 200 DK developer board is supported.
