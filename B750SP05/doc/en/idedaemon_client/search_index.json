If the command needs to be run on a device, connect the host to the device and run the command on the device.\n\nAfter Mind Studio is installed, you can log in to the Mind Studio server as the Mind Studio installation user and obtain the IDE-daemon-client tool in the  ~/tools/che/ddk/ddk/uihost/bin  directory.\nAlternatively, on the Mind Studio server, you can set environment variables and run a  IDE-daemon-client  command. This document uses this method as an example. You can also log in to the server on the host as the HwHiAiUser user and directly run a  IDE-daemon-client  command. (Currently, the PCIe mode is supported.)\n\n NOTE:~/tools  is the default  toolpath  setting, which can be customized during Mind Studio installation. You can view the value of  toolpath file in the  scripts/env.conf  file.
