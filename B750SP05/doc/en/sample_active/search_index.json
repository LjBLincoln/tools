engine-based visualized drag-and-drop programming and automatic generation of algorithmic code, greatly reducing the developer's threshold.\nService developers can orchestrate and run service processes by dragging graphical service nodes, connecting service nodes, and editing service node properties to achieve \"zero\" programming of service process orchestration.\nHiAI Engine is a universal service process engine, including the HiAI Engine Agent and HiAI Engine Manager.\n\nHiAI Engine Agent: Runs on the host side. The host refers to the x86 server, Windows PC, 3559, and AMD server connected to the device. They use the neural-network （NN） computing capability provided by the device to implement services.\n\nHiAI Engine Manager:  Runs on the device side. The device refers to the hardware device on which the NPU chip is installed. The device side is connected to the host side over the PCIe interface to provide the NN computing capability for the host.\n\n\nFigure 1  shows the interaction between Mind Studio and HiAI Engine.\nFigure  1  Interaction between Mind Studio and HiAI Engine\nIn HiAI Engine, the concept of \"engine\" refers to a specific service node. Multiple engines form a graph. The graph manages all engines.  Figure 2  shows their relationship.\nFigure  2  Relationship between the graph and engines\nThe connection between engine nodes is configured in the graph configuration file.

For details, see  Basic Node Operations.\nFigure 2  shows an example of the ResNet-18 network.\nFigure  2  ResNet-18 network example \nThe ResNet-18 network consists of the following nodes: a dataset, a model, a data pre-processing node, an execution engine, and an image post-processing node.\nProcedure\n\nAdd a model.\nIn this example,  Model > Built-in Models > Resnet18  is used.\nTo use your own model, choose  [+]  on the right of  Model > My Models.

They can also be used for the inference of the classification network and detection network. However,  CaffeInferenceEngine  can only run in a local simulation environment.  \n\n\n\nConfigure the node properties.\nTo meet the requirements of the ResNet-18 network, you need to set the properties of the  ImagePreProcess node.\n\nClick  ImagePreProcess.\nEnable the  Resize function on the  property  tab on the right.\nSet  resize_width  and  resize_height  to  224 （the function is enabled by default, and the width and height are 224）, as shown in  Figure 5.\n\nFigure  5  Modifying node properties\n\n NOTE:   \n\nThe  Resize configurations must be consistent with the model input defined by the  input_param  parameter in the .prototxt file. For the ResNet-18 model, the input data must be 224 x 224.  \nIn a simulation environment, the pre-processing node is  ImagePreProcessPillow.  \nThe configurations of  Resize  must be the consistent with that of  ImagePreProcess.  \nMean Value  also needs to be set for this node （Subtraction average value/Average value of channel n）:The B, G, and R values of the inception_v4, xcecption, and inception_v3 models are all  128. Retain the default values of  mean_of_B,  mean_of_G, and  mean_of_R  for other models. The default values are  104,  117, and  123, respectively.  \nEnable  Scale  for the densenet, moblienet, moblienet_v2, inception_v4, xcecption, and inception_v3 models. The value is the reciprocal of Multiplying Factor （Multiplying Factor = Multiplying factor/Standard deviation of channel  n  or Multiplying Factor = Reciprocal of (Max – Min）.
