USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 are both supported.  \n\nWhen connecting to the Atlas 200 DK developer board over the USB port, you need to configure the static USB IP address. The following describes how to configure the static IP address by using the script or manually:\n\nConfiguration by using the script\n\nDownload  configure_usb_ethernet.sh from  https://github.com/Ascend/tools/blob/master/configure_usb_ethernet.sh  to any directory on the Ubuntu server where Mind Studio is located, for example,  /home/ascend/config_usb_ip/.\n\n NOTE:If you want to download a single file from GitHub, right-click  Raw and choose  Save link as  from the shortcut menu.  \n\n\nGo to the directory where the script for configuring the USB IP address is located as the  root user, for example,  /home/ascend/config_usb_ip.\n\nRun the following command to configure the USB IP address:\n\nbash configure_usb_ethernet.sh**-s** ip_address\nUse the specified IP address to configure the static IP address of the USB network adapter in the system. If  bash configure_usb_ethernet.sh  is run, the default IP address  192.168.1.166  is used.\n\nIf multiple USB network adapters exist, run the  ifconfig  command to query the name of the USB network adapter, and then run the following command to configure the IP address of the specified network adapter:\nbash configure_usb_ethernet.sh -s usb_nic_name ip_address\nusb_nic_name: name of the USB network adapter \nip_address: specified IP address\nExample command:\nbash configure_usb_ethernet.sh -s enp0s20f0u8 192.168.1.236\n\n\nAfter the configuration is complete, run the  ifconfig  command to check whether the IP address takes effect.\n\n\n\nManual configuration\n\nLog in to the Mind Studio server as the Mind Studio installation user and run the following command to switch to the  root user:\nsu - root\n\nObtain the name of the USB network adapter.\nifconfig -a\n\nAdd the static IP address of the USB network adapter to the  /etc/network/interfaces  file.\nRun the following command to open the  interfaces  file:\nvi /etc/network/interfaces\nConfigure the  interfaces file as follows.
