processing unit （NPU）. On Mind Studio, you can develop chip-based operators, and develop custom operators. Network migration, optimization, and analysis at the network layer is also supported. In addition, the service engine layer provides a set of visualized AI engine drag-and-drop programming services, which greatly reduces the AI engine development threshold. The entire platform provides the following four services for developers in a Web manner.\n\nFor operator development:\nMind Studio provides development of a full set of operators. It supports running in a real environment, visualized debugging of heterogeneous programs that are dynamically scheduled and third-party operator development, greatly reducing the operator development threshold based on Huawei-developed NPUs, improving the efficiency of operator development and enhancing product competitiveness.\n\nFor development at the network layer:\nMind Studio integrates the offline model conversion tool （OMG）, model quantization tool, model running profiling tool, and log analysis tool, greatly improving the efficiency of migration, analysis and optimization of network models.\n\nFor AI engine development:\nMind Studio provides the AI engine that supports visualized drag-and-drop programming and a large number of automatic algorithm code generation technologies, largely reducing the threshold for developers. Mind Studio is equipped with various algorithm engines, such as ResNet-18, boosting the development and migration efficiency of the user AI algorithm engine.\n\nFor application development:\nMind Studio integrates various tools, such as Profile and Compiler, providing a graphically integrated development environment. Developers can perform full-process development on Mind Studio, covering project management, compilation, commissioning, simulation, and performance analysis, greatly enhancing the development efficiency.\n\n\n"},"function-description.html":{"url":"function-description.html","title":"Function Description","keywords":"","body":"Function Description\nOverall Architecture\nFigure 1  shows the overall architecture of Mind Studio.\nFigure  1  Overall architecture of Mind Studio\nFunction Description\nMind Studio provides the following features:\n\nUser-friendly NPU-based programming GUI\nOperator developers can customize CCE development on Mind Studio based on the CCE programming depth to implement in-depth integration. The keywords of the extended CCE language are highlighted. You can compile heterogeneous hybrid codes in one-click mode.\n\nNPU-based graphical debugging\nFor the development of the operator acceleration library on the NPU, Mind Studio provides a graphical GUI for users to implement real-time tracking of the running status of the acceleration operators on the AI core and AI CPU.\n\nAutomatic offline model management\nTrained third-party models, such as Caffe and TensorFlow models, can be imported to Mind Studio and converted into models supported by the system. Model interfaces are generated automatically in one-click mode, enabling interface-based model programming. For details, see 4 \"Offline Model Conversion\" in the  Mind Studio Quick Start.\n\n\"Zero\" programming for service process orchestration\nFor service process developers, Mind Studio provides the drag-and-drop programming mode based on service nodes. You can implement service orchestration by simply dragging and connecting service nodes. The one-stop service after orchestration, ranging from compilation and running to result display, makes process development smarter. \"Zero\" programming is involved. In this way, you can get started quickly without extra learning costs. For details, see 3 \"Building the First Machine Learning App\" in the  Mind Studio Quick Start  .\n\nGraphical TE programming\nMind Studio provides the industry's first integrated development environment based on the TVM-based Tensor Engine （TE） for programming development. Operators can be transplanted quickly across platforms, enabling instant NPU adaption.\n\nLog Analysis\nMind Studio provides a system-wide log collection and analysis solution for the NPU platform, improving the efficiency of locating runtime algorithm problems. A unified log format is adopted. Visualized analysis of cross-platform logs and runtime diagnosis runs in Web mode, improving the usability of the log analysis system.\n\nPerformance analysis\nMind Studio provides graphical user interfaces （GUIs） and command-line interfaces (CLIs) to implement efficient, easy-to-use, and flexible performance profiling on the multi-node and multi-module heterogeneous system on the host and device. Synchronous analysis of performance and power consumption of the NPU device is implemented, which meets the requirements of algorithm optimization for system performance analysis.\n\nSimulation\nFunction-level simulation execution libraries for the AI core under the Caffe framework are provided. You can call AI core simulation by using the program.\n\n\n"},"user-management.html":{"url":"user-management.html","title":"User Management","keywords":"","body":"User Management\nMind Studio provides the user management function that allows users to change login passwords.\n\nLogging In  \n\nResetting the Password  \n\nChanging the Password  \n\nLogging Out  \n\nQuerying Security Logs  \n\n\n"},"logging-in.html":{"url":"logging-in.html","title":"Logging In","keywords":"","body":"Logging In\nFigure 1  shows the login page.\nFigure  1  Login page\nTable 1  describes the parameters on the page.\nTable  1  Parameters on the login page\n\nParameter\n\nDescription\n\n\n\nUser Name\n\nLogin user name.

This section uses this method as an example.\nLog in to the Mind Studio server as the Mind Studio installation user, switch to the  ~/tools/che/ddk/ddk/uihost/bin  directory, configure environment variables, and run the  omg  command.\nConfigure environment variables. Especially, replace  /home/ascend/tools  with the actual tool path.\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/ascend/tools/che/ddk/ddk/uihost/lib/\nThe following is an example of the  omg  command:\n./omg --h\n\n NOTE:~/tools  is the default  toolpath  setting, which can be customized during Mind Studio installation. You can view the value of  toolpath in the  scripts/env.conf  file. You can run the  find / -name 'env.conf'  command to view the location of the  env.conf  file in the  script directory.  \n\n\n\nUsage Example\n\nLog in to the server on the host as the  HwHiAiUser  user.\nRun the following commands to generate an encrypted model file:\nomg --model=/usr/local/HiAI/driver/tools/test/resnet18.prototxt --weight=/usr/local/HiAI/driver/tools/test/resnet18.caffemodel --framework=0 --output=/usr/local/HiAI/driver/tools/test/out/caffe_resnet18 --encrypt_mode=0 --encrypt_key=/usr/local/HiAI/driver/tools/test/ek_key --hardware_key=/usr/local/HiAI/driver/tools/test/isv_hw_key --certificate=/usr/local/HiAI/driver/tools/test/isv_cert.crt --private_key=/usr/local/HiAI/driver/tools/test/isv_prikey.key\nAfter the commands are executed successfully, you can view the encrypted model file （for example,  caffe_resnet18.om） and the encrypted file for decrypting the model file (for example,  caffe_resnet18.PASSCODE) in the path specified by the  output parameter.\n\n\n"},"model-management-in-the-projects-explorer-window.html":{"url":"model-management-in-the-projects-explorer-window.html","title":"Model Management in the Projects Explorer Window","keywords":"","body":"Model Management in the Projects Explorer Window\n\nViewing the Models  \n\nAdding a Caffe Model Component  \n\nViewing Model Properties  \n\nViewing the Network Structure of a Model  \n\nDeleting a Model Component  \n\n\n"},"viewing-the-models.html":{"url":"viewing-the-models.html","title":"Viewing the Models","keywords":"","body":"Viewing the Models\n\nDouble-click the .mind file of a Mind Engine project to open the Engine orchestration window.\nManage the network models in the  Model area on the  tool tab page.
